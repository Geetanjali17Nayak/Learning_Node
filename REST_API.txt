REST API stands for REpresentational State Transfer API. 
It is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that allows communication between different systems over the internet. 
REST APIs work by sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format, between the client and server.

REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to define actions that can be performed on resources. 
These methods align with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which are used to manipulate resources over the web.

A request is sent from the client to the server via a web URL, using one of the HTTP methods. 
The server then responds with the requested resource, which could be HTML, XML, Image, or JSON, with JSON being the most commonly used format for modern web services.
